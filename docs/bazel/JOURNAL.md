# Autoware + Bazel integration journal

## 2026-11-13: Define scope and validation gates

Goal: define the experiment's initial scope on Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64, with a
headless planning simulator in an OCI image as the first end-to-end milestone.

Changes: added PLAN.md with goals and validation gates. Development uses local
branch `bazel`, with direct pushes to `paulsohn/bazel` and signed-off
Conventional Commits.

Validation: `git diff --check` passed. This change contains documentation only;
no build or runtime experiments have been performed.

Next: scope cleanup, pinned Bazel workspace and talker/listener smoke checks.

## 2026-11-13: Plan the bootstrap experiment

Goal: define repository working rules and a Phase 0 experiment that discovers
the required Bazel and RCR configuration through a minimal ROS publisher and
subscriber.

Changes:

- added root `AGENTS.md` with source-layout, commit, validation, and journaling
  rules;
- narrowed PLAN.md to decisions supported before bootstrap and moved later work
  into phase boundaries and open questions;
- added DEVELOPING.md for local configuration, clean-environment commands,
  commit boundaries, and validation language;
- added empty, evidence-gated UPSTREAM_RCR.md and UPSTREAM_AWF.md notebooks;
- ignored Bazel convenience symlinks and developer-specific `user.bazelrc`.

Validation: documentation and ignore-rule change only. `git diff --check`, the
repository's `markdownlint` and `prettier` hooks, and ignore checks for
`bazel-bin` and `user.bazelrc` passed. No build or runtime experiment was
performed.

Next: inspect current RCR bootstrap guidance and release metadata, then add only
the workspace configuration needed by the talker/listener experiment.
